# ThousandDelimiterJS
Delimiter for numbers in JavaScript / jQuery.

Easily configurable to fit specific localizational needs.

Demo on https://jsfiddle.net/dubbelb/867wm0dt/1/

## Instructions:
Add a reference to the js-file.
Call the plugin via javascript or jQuery:
$(selector).thousanddelimiterjs();

Each element can have their own thousand and decimal delimiter styling through a data-tag. Use *thousand-delimiter* and *decimal-delimiter*. If nothing is set it will pick the default which is assigned in the JS-file and can be modified to fit the need.

### Important:
Dependent on jQuery (developed on 2.1.4 but probably works on other versions as well)
